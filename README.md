# `nextMail` â€” the calendar App

### Prerequisites

Node, Grunt, Bower.

### Clone `teamPost`

Clone the `teamPost` repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/rahulmeghlan/teamPost.git
cd teamPost
```

### Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`. After that, you should find out that you have
two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the Angular framework files


### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].
